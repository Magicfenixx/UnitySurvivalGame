Project Overview

This project is a 2D sandbox survival game.

It challenges players to survive against endless waves of zombies on a flat endless terrain map. 

Players can gather resources, build structures, and purchase buffs like guns and bombs to enhance their survival.

The objective is to kill as many zombies as possible, with increasing difficulty every 5 points.

The game encourages repeated plays to achieve higher scores, with increasing difficulty keeping the challenge fresh. Balancing resource gathering, building, and fighting zombies and skeletons adds strategic depth, as players must choose the right buffs at the right time to enhance their survival.

This blend of survival and strategy elements ensures engaging and dynamic gameplay.
